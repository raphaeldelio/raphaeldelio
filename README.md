Hey! 

My name is Raphael De Lio — pronounced /ra-fa-el deh lee-oh/ — a curious mind who can’t help but improve whatever I touch. I’m a software engineer with over eight years hopping across roles, industries, and countries.

Born under Brazilian skies, I spent six years in Portugal before landing in the Netherlands in 2022. My craft has been code: Java and Kotlin on distributed systems are my bread and butter, and I’ve also stirred the community pot as organizer and host of the Dutch Kotlin User Group in Amsterdam.

These days I’m a Developer Advocate at Redis — a role where I mix code, community, and creativity. I get to build, teach, and share sparks that help developers everywhere solve problems faster (and hopefully have more fun along the way).

If you’re building something cool and need a hand, or just want to talk about Kotlin, Redis, databases, or community magic, I’m always up for a chat.
