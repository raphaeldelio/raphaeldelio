Hey! 

My name's Raphael De Lio, and I'm a software developer with multiple years of experience. Software engineering is the tool I found to nurture my passion which lies in solving problems. 

Currently, I've been enjoying developing with Kotlin and Flutter and experimenting with Redis. I have an YouTube channel where I share my latest coding adventures and a Medium page with the same purpose.
